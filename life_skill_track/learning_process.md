# LEARNING PROCESS

## 1 Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique :

### Feyman Technique:
If you Want to understand means wehave to explain it.if we know some concepts and good knowledge in that  we have to explain to someone or myself.we explain means it helps to good grip in that concept to us.
*  **choose a concept to learn** :
 First we have to choose a topic and we have to write the topic name in paper , it help us to remaind what topic we learn.
* **Teach it yourself or someone** :
 We have to write what weknow about the project and explaing yourself or someone in your own words that shows how much knowledge you have in that topic.
 and we have to explain or practicing with examples also it is usefull to understand.

* **Return to the source material if you get Stuck** :
 If we try to explaining if we forget something or get stuck in something means we have go to the source material where do you get that topics.

* **Simplify your Explanation** :
 If We trying to explanation or soliving problems if you get any problem or error means you have to solve using source it helps to explain simply to someone or yourself.

### 2 different ways to implement this technique in my learning process :

* whatever concept i know i will recall it and explain it for myself.
* If any one of my team mate or co-worker doesn't have basic knowledge in certain concept means i will explain them .
* If i am getting or any one of them get error i will try to solve that using source files.

## 3 TED talk by Barbara Oakley

when you want to learn you just love language and culture.The brain have enormously complex and we can simplify its into two modes ,
* Focus mode:
 mode is just we are focusing something.

* Difuse mode :
mode is relaxing neural states.

We can take the pinball  as a example and we are put pinball in right your brain.we need different way of thinking,and new perspective.


In diffuse mode when you think a thought , it takes off ,and it range very widely,as your attempting and come up with some new ideas.we  can't keep focusing in one thing and take relax in diffuse mode and come up with new ideas.

If your trying to solve a problem or new concept when you get stuck  you want to turn attention away from the problem and allow to diffuse mode,those are resting states to do their work in background.whenever get a stuck in solving problem first sit down and relax mind then we can get ideas , and take those ideas in difuse mode and put in focus mode it may be solve or refine  the problem.

If you love to **Procrastinate** means we can handle this using two ways ,
* we are keep working on that problem to solve.
* just turn away your attention and come up with new problem.

we can do this  at once  or twice if we keep doing this means it cause problems, to avoid that we can use pomodoro technique.

**Pomodoro Technique :** we can take a timer and set up for 25 minutes and focusing a work 25 minutes turn off everything like mobiles ect.. ,and then relax or make fun acivities in few minutes.It help you to focus on learn.when you trying pomodoro We don't think that we done all assingnments in 25 minutes ,we just think we can work for 25 minutes with focus.

We can understand that relaxation is also a important  part of learning.

We don't think we are slow thinker to compare with others just kept more hard work and keep going .keep practicing practice make you better. 
Test your self everytime,study at differnt places , if you get a assignment don't try once complete and througho it away just practicing those home work again  and again. 


### 4 different ways to implement this technique in my learning process:

* If am getting stuck i kept attention away from it, and i come with new solution for that problem.
* I am set up some time to work with focus.
* I am practicing Each code several times.
* I am never thinking about slower thinking and faster thinking and never work just like to complete the task learn and completev .

## 5 Learn Anything in 20 hours:
If you need to learn new skill means we need 10000 hours to learn new skill,this rule came out for studies for experts -level performance and it came from florid state university. **Anders Ericsson** originator of 10000 hour rule. If you spend 10000 hours to practice and learn we can be a top of that field.

People can get things with their based on their practices.

We can learn any new skill with just 20 hrs if we put 20 hrs of focused deliberate practice into any thing will be Astounded at how good you are in that field.

* **Deconstruct the Skill:**
First we have to decide Exactly what we want,in Every new Skill have lot of things we just focus on what we need and get what we want.Keep practice big things it will improve your performance.

* **Learn Enough to Self Correct:**
Whatever you read and see videos but we have to practice  and never procrastinate the practice .when you practice Self check and self correction is helps to get better and you can know Where you are do mistakes .

* **Remove Barrier:**
When you start practicing means you have to tuned off everything which all are make disturbance like tv,mobiles musics ect.. only focusing on work.

### 6 some of the steps that I can while approaching a new topic

* I have to Searching in google or Read books or seeing videos and i am practicing multiple times.
* I learn What I need  in that New topic .
* If i am Start learn just focusing only that topic.
* If any disturbance means I am away from that places or things.
